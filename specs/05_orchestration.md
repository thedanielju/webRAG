## Orchestration
1. only layer deciding what to recurse
2. selects links to ingest
3. loops until stop

previous layers are treated as primitives
1. discovery = candidates
2. ingestion = fetch me content
3. indexing = make it retrievable
4. retrieval/answering = can we answer now

these endpoints from firecrawl could have utility
batch_scrape 
search
